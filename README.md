## Introduction

Welcome to Hacktoberfest-Tulip, an open-source initiative aimed at detecting and combating the spread of fake news. In this age of information, ensuring the authenticity and reliability of information is paramount.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual, month-long festival of open source sponsored by DigitalOcean, GitHub, and various other partners. During October, this event celebrates open-source contributions and encourages participation in the open-source community. Contributors submit pull requests to repositories hosted on GitHub and, based on their quality and adherence to repository guidelines, may earn rewards.

## Project Motivation

Fake news is not just misinformation; it's a challenge to the very essence of information trustworthiness. False information can have severe consequences, from swaying public opinion on important issues to inciting unwarranted fear or prejudice.

This project was born from the need for tools that can efficiently and accurately detect misleading information. Our goal is to leverage the power of the open-source community to build, refine, and advance a tool that ensures a more reliable flow of information.

## How Does It Work?

Hacktoberfest-Tulip uses a combination of machine learning models, data analysis techniques, and community-contributed rulesets to analyze and assess the authenticity of news articles. Our tool will:

- Scan and analyze the content of news articles
- Compare the information against trusted sources and datasets
- Assign a credibility score based on various factors
- Flag suspicious or potentially misleading content for review
